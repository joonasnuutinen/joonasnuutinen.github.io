## Responsibilities

- Designing the architecture and data model for a headless website.
- Implementing a Strapi backend with custom GraphQL endpoints.
- Integrating a Next.js frontend with the backend and overseeing the React development of UI components.
- Setting up a CI/CD workflow that builds Docker images of the frontend and backend and deploys them to Kubernetes (Hetzner Cloud).

- Implementing a server-side Google Tag Manager data layer.
- Technical documentation and support.
- Optimising all Google Lighthouse scores to 90+.
