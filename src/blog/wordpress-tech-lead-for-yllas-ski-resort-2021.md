## Responsibilities

- Owning the technical implementation of the new [ski.yllas.fi](https://ski.yllas.fi/) website.
- Setting up a local Docker environment and CI/CD processes with automatic deployments to [Seravo](https://seravo.com/en/).
- Developing PHP templates with [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/).
- Designing and implementing a custom integration to fetch weather and slope data with [Transient caching](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/transients/).
